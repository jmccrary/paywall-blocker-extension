# Paywall Blocker #

This extension successfully blocks the paywall provided by [pulaskinews.net](www.pulaskinews.net "Pulaski News").  This website happens to host 4 major newspapers Pulaski County including:

1. The North Little Rock Times
2. The Maumelle Monitor
3. The Jacksonville Patriot
4. The Sherwood Voice

If you ever find yourself linked to one of these newspapers and you don't actively read it, why would you pay $36 for a year of articles?  You wouldn't, because it doesn't make sense.  That's where Paywall Blocker comes in!
